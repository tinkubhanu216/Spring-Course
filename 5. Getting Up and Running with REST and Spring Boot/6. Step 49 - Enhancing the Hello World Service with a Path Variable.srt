00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:09,190
Welcome back! When we talked about the resource mappings, we said some of the values would be passed in the path

2
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:19,300
parameters. So, here Slash user slash Id. Id is a path parameter. In this step, what we'll do is we'll create another

3
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:25,660
simple hello world bean request with a  path parameter. What I'll do is I'll copy this

4
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:33,130
And what we want to do is we want to pass in a param. What we'll say is we’ll create a URI - hello world 

5
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:36,250
path variable slash.

6
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,400
I’d want to accept the path variable in here.

7
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:44,220
I would need to give a name to the variable so I’ll call it name.

8
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:51,490
So what would happen here is when I get a request let's say path variable slash in28minutes, then

9
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:56,230
in28minutes will be mapped to this variable name.

10
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:59,570
So let's create a variable to take that. So that’s called string name,

11
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:00,240
right?

12
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:01,390
Is that sufficient?

13
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:02,830
Actually it's not.

14
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:06,720
I’d need to add an annotation called at path variable.

15
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:09,200
And now it's imported in.

16
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,610
Now what would happen is when somebody types in a URI- in28minutes -  it would get mapped to the

17
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:15,610
name in here.

18
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:22,360
So this in28minutes would be what would be mapped into name. I’ll change the name of the method.

19
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,620
It doesn't really matter.

20
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,920
But let's change it. Hello world

21
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:34,150
path variable. Over here I would want to use a format. So I’ll say hello world percentage S. I’ll use a name

22
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,390
in here.

23
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:39,210
So I'll say a string dot format. string dot format.

24
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:46,620
And this is the format to use and I'll say use the arguments - name.

25
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:47,270
What would happen?

26
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:52,560
This percentage S would be replaced with name and this hello world bean

27
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,110
would be returned back.

28
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,190
So what we're creating here is very simple, right?

29
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:01,330
What we want to do is to take this path variable and whatever value is coming back,

30
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:07,180
We are creating a hello world bean with this string template and returning that back.

31
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:15,190
It's a simple example to show the power of path variables. In all our social media application resource

32
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,020
mappings,

33
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,880
we will use path parameter extensively.

34
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:24,810
So here we are mapping user id. Here we’re using post Id. In restful applications,

35
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:29,810
we make extensive use of the path variables. These are also called path parameters.

36
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:36,120
Now let's start the application and I'll copy this hello world path variable in28minutes down here.

37
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:43,330
So it's localhost 8080 hello world path variable in28minutes and you're seeing now that it's coming back

38
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,290
with a response, Hello world

39
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,910
in28minutes. Whatever I am passing in as a path variable is getting replaced in here.

40
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:51,000
Let's change it again.

41
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,080
Hello World Ranga.

42
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:54,220
This is getting us hello world Ranga.

43
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:57,920
So whatever value we are passing in is being picked up by the controller.

44
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:05,050
And it is being sent back in the response. Path variables are a critical part of creating REST resources.

45
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,320
We’ll make extensive use of path

46
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:12,910
variables in this specific course. In this step, we learned how to create a path variable and how to pick

47
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:16,440
up the value from it and use it in a controller method.

48
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:17,900
Until the next step, bye-bye.
