Welcome back. If you have any problems with importing the code for JWT in the previous step, then this
1

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,920
would really help you.
2

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:17,600
What are the things you can do, is you can actually go to a file called final.md.
3

4
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:20,130
So 00-00 final.md
4

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,670
On our github repository.
5

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:29,330
If you open that file up and you search for /JWT/ that's what you would need to search for
6

7
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:35,140
/JWT/, you'd end up with the list of files down here.
7

8
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,680
So you see that there are a number of JWT files which are present in here.
8

9
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:47,700
So if you have a specific compilation error with any of the files, then what you can do is you can copy
9

10
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:52,890
that specific file. So let's say you are having a compilation error with a jwt token. You can just
10

11
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:58,700
copy that specific file from here, and paste it into your IDE.
11

12
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:04,530
The idea behind this step is to show you how you can fix any compilation errors that you are unable
12

13
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,920
to fix with the JWT code.
13

14
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:08,660
I'll see you in the next step.
