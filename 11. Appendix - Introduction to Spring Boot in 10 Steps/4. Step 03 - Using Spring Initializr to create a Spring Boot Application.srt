00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:08,060
Welcome back in the step we create a simple springboard project and look at all the magic.

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:15,490
A simple start to project controlled the way you can create a springboard project is by going to start

3
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:16,510
tapping dirt at your.

4
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,230
Very simple stuff.

5
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:22,540
You just do a google search for something and Shalako you should be able to easily get here.

6
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:28,020
Start to bring you once you are here I would need to choose.

7
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:33,480
I would use Mavin as my build to Java as the language you can use any question of springboard which

8
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,560
is greater than 2.2.

9
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,860
I use 2.00 0 snapchat.

10
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:43,030
I hope by the time you do this course there will be greater question of point 2 as well.

11
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:50,400
You can use any of those versions and all here I would need to configure a name for my project just

12
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:57,010
like you give a class name and a package name to each class you would need to give a group ID and effect

13
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:59,120
ID to each project.

14
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:06,830
So I would go ahead and give that to a Commodore in 28 minutes or putting board basics and I'll call

15
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:17,780
this spring board in 10 steps and do this you can add startup projects startup projects makes it very

16
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,600
easy to develop applications.

17
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:27,940
We would want to develop a simple service and to be able to develop a service we need to do is start

18
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:28,270
there.

19
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:30,680
So you'll need to use springboard to start a web.

20
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:37,290
So I'm adding a vibes that you can see that in here so you can see that there is a vibe added in here.

21
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:44,730
Now you can go ahead and Gendry project once you click that project a zip file would be downloaded to

22
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,510
your Downloads folder.

23
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:51,330
What I would need you to do is you take that zip file and zip it.

24
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:59,610
Do any folder on your hard disk and not don't pop to that folder to actually going to project this or

25
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:05,790
download a zip file and zip zip zip file to a folder on my hard disk in 28 minutes.

26
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:11,220
Get getting started in 5 steps spring boot in 10 steps.

27
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:16,220
You can actually unzip it to any folder on your local hard drive.

28
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:23,660
I would go into eclipse and import that project or what I lose file import existing Maimon projects

29
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:28,300
and you can paste in the directory with you and it did.

30
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,620
Or you can use the Browse to browse to that specific data.

31
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:37,710
Either of these things should be fine once you are able to successfully select the directory you see

32
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,130
bringing in 10 steps upon darksome.

33
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,470
So I would go ahead and click Finish now.

34
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:51,000
What would happen in the background is now eclipse would look at the maven configuration and start downloading

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,860
all the other stuff that is needed.

36
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:58,320
So you'd see that it would start to download all the dependencies and all that kind of stuff.

37
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:02,110
This is the first time using springboard then this might take a little while.

38
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:07,020
It might take a few minutes for the whole configuration and the creation of the project to complete

39
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:08,630
the entire thing has completed.

40
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:14,740
And now if you look at it right now this is the project which has been created.

41
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:22,440
We have a local source manger where all our Java code is Salsman resources IIS resources folder.

42
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:27,600
One of the files which would with the application that properties will talk about it a little later.

43
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,240
So as Java has the best.

44
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:33,990
Other than that you should see a lot of Mammon dependencies.

45
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:34,880
Check coming in.

46
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:41,350
You can see that there are a wide variety of dependencies that are coming in right now.

47
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:46,170
You will look at why these dependencies are coming in a little later.

48
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:50,390
For now let's see if you're able to start this application up.

49
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:58,170
So I'll open up spring boot in 10 steps application and I would right click and see.

50
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,530
Run down application.

51
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:06,440
Actually we have not really implemented any code as such so there is nothing that is implemented right

52
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,020
now.

53
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:12,960
All that we are looking for is to see if the software has started fine or not.

54
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:21,710
Do you see something like this started spinning in 10 steps application in seconds on port 80 80.

55
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:29,450
And if you look at the details of the log you would see that there are a lot of things happening already.

56
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:36,450
However the most important part is the fact that you have web application up and running.

57
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:42,170
We would look at different things which are present in this log and understand what is happening in

58
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:43,180
the background.

59
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:46,570
A lot more in the future steps.

60
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:47,830
Until then I.
