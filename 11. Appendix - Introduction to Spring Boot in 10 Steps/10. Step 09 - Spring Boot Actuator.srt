1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:05,530
In this step we will investigate much more about world trade.

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:12,950
How do I use Greenwood actuator where you seem just like everything else it's putting board using an

3
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:15,810
actuator is also really very simple.

4
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:18,550
All that I need to do is good for America.

5
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:20,430
And you have guessed it right.

6
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,590
I just need to add stuff for actuator.

7
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:30,710
So I'm copping the start of a verb and changing the starter name to actually after that it implies that

8
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:34,080
I didn't start to fracture it.

9
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,380
So what does the actuator bring in.

10
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:42,940
Actually it actually brings in a lot of monitoring around your application.

11
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:49,710
So in actuator you'd be able to read a lot of data about the application.

12
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,710
Let's say you want to see water the beans that are configured.

13
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:56,030
You want to see how Arta configuration has worked.

14
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:02,210
You want to see how many times the specific services call you want to see how many times a specific

15
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:04,250
service has failed.

16
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:11,970
All that kind of stuff you can check in your actuator and all that I need to do to enable that is in

17
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:19,410
something called an actuator in springboard that the actuator actually exposes a lot of the rest services

18
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:25,840
and these services are compliant with the standard called had standard.

19
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:34,540
And we would use a whole browser so that we can browse through the data which is provided by the service

20
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:39,610
agency for help browser it spring bitterest help browser.

21
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:43,380
So it's spring data rest Hal.

22
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:50,510
So you can take the project up the group ID should actually be data it offspring from a data spring

23
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,210
that at least help browser.

24
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:58,250
So once we add dependency for that the browser would be configured among our dependencies.

25
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:01,770
Now you can see all the dependencies in the Miami independent It's been a good start.

26
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:05,750
Actually it does bring good actually to spend the rest Harrel browser.

27
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,650
That's cool.

28
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:11,900
One of the important things to remember is that the actuator you are Lil's have been changing quite

29
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:20,120
a lot across spring board release in spring bought one dart X the UL and was localhost 88 the slash

30
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:28,220
actuator and later in the earlier versions of spring point zero point zero like the milestone resists

31
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:38,010
it was last 88 slash application number again we are back to normal last ADHD slash actuator.

32
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:41,240
So this is the you are going to launch up the actuator.

33
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:48,090
I mean this is after point zero point zero dot release the UI released localhost 88 the slash actuator.

34
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:55,000
It does not work and probably you can do close ADHD Sless application right once you type in localhost

35
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:56,790
88 ADHD Lesch actuator.

36
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:02,390
This is what you'd be seeing if you're using anything greater than to point to point two leagues you'd

37
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:05,070
see three you Errol's coming in.

38
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:05,540
Right.

39
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,300
So these are the held and the informed.

40
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:12,800
So if I click help you'd see they held up the applications up and running.

41
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,600
That's cool.

42
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:14,470
Right.

43
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:17,710
And the other one is the Imphal.

44
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:25,620
There is not a lot of info here right now if there is a lot of stuff that actuator pro-white to enable

45
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:29,610
that you'd need to configure but how do I do that.

46
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:35,270
The way you can with that is called You Are piggishness properties and back pain management endpoint

47
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:43,110
web Dorte exposure don't include a sequel to the sequel to start.

48
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:49,920
What we are doing in here is we are enabling the ebay exposure so the exposure overhead should DP of

49
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,510
all the management points.

50
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:59,190
One of the important things to remember is when you enable a lot of tracking a lot of auditing.

51
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:03,010
What would happen is there would be a performance impact as well.

52
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:09,320
One of the recommendations is to identify which of the things that you would want and only enable those.

53
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,150
But for now we are taking a shortcut.

54
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:17,280
We are enabling everything management endpoints web exposure that include physical stuff all the things

55
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:23,540
you would already know is the fact that if I type in controlled space or comment space you'd see a dropdown

56
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,400
coming in.

57
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,000
This is because of something called a spring tools plug in.

58
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:31,180
So there's an eclipse plugin called Spring tools.

59
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:37,290
You can see that I can see what develop properties it also validates the values of these properties

60
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:41,830
and things like that we configured management or the endpoints that we have got exposure include is

61
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:48,750
called just to save it and restart your application to make make sure that you stop and start your application

62
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,540
and go and refresh the actuator.

63
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,470
You'd see that now.

64
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,700
There are many more articles which are present in here.

65
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:00,030
So you would see a lot of which are coming up in here.

66
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:04,950
The other thing we can type in this localhost ADHD we have already added in the whole browser.

67
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,220
Let's zoom out a little bit.

68
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:12,840
So we added in the hull brothers so if you type in localhost ADHD you go to the browser and we can use

69
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:18,890
help browser to browse through the actuators I can type in slash actuator in here.

70
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:23,820
So all that I need to do is type in slash actuator that the you are in for the actual in here and I

71
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:29,090
can start looking through all the things related to actuators directly from here.

72
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:36,920
Let's look at a few of these things that the actuator is exposing the oddity when it is related to security.

73
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:40,720
Or did you want to show that users who were properly validated.

74
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,630
How many people failed the authentication and all that kind of stuff.

75
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,360
Beans is an interesting thing.

76
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:53,130
And picking beans they Sutro all this green beans that are configured right praying is a dependency

77
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:59,790
management framework and it manages all the bins it creates all the components for you and you can look

78
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:02,950
at all the beams that spring has created for you.

79
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:05,790
You can also check the health of the application its up.

80
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:11,480
Conditions is another interesting thing as we have this because it knows being good is all about auto

81
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,620
configuration.

82
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:18,420
There is a lot of stuff that being built or configured conditioned so it exposes the positive matches

83
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:25,230
which are all the conditions that matched as well as if you search for negative matches the conditions

84
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:31,020
which did not match so it would draw a list of bins which are configured which are not trigger and all

85
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,330
that kind of stuff.

86
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:35,230
You can also get the details of configuration properties.

87
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:40,550
And we don't mind loggers which are configured You can also get them to read them.

88
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:47,850
And also you can get a few metrics as well so if you go to the metrics I can see a list of metrics which

89
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,380
are valid.

90
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,790
So let's say I would want to find out how much memory is used.

91
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:58,860
So I can say I can copy this JVM memory used and add it in here.

92
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:02,080
Slash JVM maybe not used to go.

93
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,480
You would see the value of the amount of memory that is being used.

94
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:09,610
The same thing can be done with other metrics as well.

95
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:15,930
So if I go back to the actual metrics you can see that there are a wide variety of metrics that are

96
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,970
being exposed in here.

97
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,640
C.P. usage and all that kind of stuff.

98
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:25,870
If I go back again to the actuator I can also see the stuff you can do to us.

99
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:31,620
That is an interesting thing called HTP trees which should all the requests that were executed.

100
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,560
So it shows that this is a request which is coming in.

101
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:40,250
Somebody like the X the actuator This is the response which when bag the time it can be so and so.

102
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:45,960
So you can see all the details of the previous requests that were executed.

103
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,890
The important thing is to remember that this would have a performance impact.

104
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:50,070
Right.

105
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,990
You cannot enable it in production.

106
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:58,500
This is useful to trace a few requests but obviously you would not want to enable it to decrease in

107
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:04,560
production for all that it was the last one which is present in here is the mappings mappings shows

108
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:09,390
all the different things that are mapped to our eyes.

109
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:16,040
Right now where we are creating a web application or a web service we are mapping a lot of it whenever

110
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,530
we are adding the dependency on next year we add a few users as well.

111
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:23,940
So you can see all the mappings in here.

112
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:30,540
The idea behind this was to quickly give you an overview of what are all the things you can do with

113
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:37,160
actually if some of the information you see in here is complex and you are finding it difficult to understand.

114
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,250
No problem at all.

115
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:44,220
The most important thing to understand is in future if you need any such information there is one place

116
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,820
you can go to that actuate.

117
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,020
And then the next step.
