00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:08,010
One of the best things to do to understand the beauty of Spring Boot is to understand how things were

2
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:14,410
done before Spring Boot. In this step, we'll look at one of the projects which we developed in our Spring MVC

3
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:21,330
course. Before we start with any project, we need to decide what frameworks and dependencies to use.

4
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:26,720
This was a web project, so we would want to use Spring MVC and things like that.

5
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:33,200
So we needed to make decisions on what frameworks and what version of them to use.

6
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:41,640
We needed to decide, I would want to use Spring MVC and Spring security web, Spring security config.

7
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:46,290
I would want to use Jackson databind because I want to do some binding and validation.

8
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:53,190
I would want to use JSTL and I would want to use Hibernate validator and also for logging I would

9
00:00:53,190 --> 00:01:00,570
want to add in log4j. We had to decide what dependencies to add in to our projects.

10
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:05,010
Not only that, we needed to decide the versions of them as well.

11
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:10,830
Sometimes this 5.0.2.FINAL version might not be compatible with some other version of

12
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:11,730
Spring MVC.

13
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:17,940
So you needed to decide what are the comparable versions and start using them. Choosing the frameworks

14
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:26,270
to use and which version to use is a major decision that we needed to make when we were not using Spring Boot.

15
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:30,530
We needed to implement default exception handling.

16
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:39,210
You can see that here, we are just implementing simple default exception handling and we needed to create

17
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:42,530
a complete Spring configuration file.

18
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:50,670
We needed to define the component scan and then we would need to configure a view resolver to redirect the views

19
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:53,900
to a JSP. To implement internationalization,

20
00:01:54,030 --> 00:02:01,770
We needed to implement a message source and also a locale resolver and in addition to that we needed

21
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:04,440
to configure our web.xml as well.

22
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:10,200
We needed to configure the dispatcher servlet in web.xml so that it can handle all the requests and

23
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,970
act as a front controller.

24
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:18,220
We needed to configure the contex configuration location in here and we also needed to configure the

25
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:26,070
Spring security. We needed to configure the filter for it and make sure that it intercepts all the request.

26
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:32,190
There is a lot of work that you would need to do to get a simple web application up and running. We configured

27
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:37,620
dependencies, dependency version, Spring configuration, configuration for internationalization, logging

28
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:43,650
and a lot of other stuff. All these stuff which we looked at in this specific step is the kind of stuff

29
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:51,120
which you don't need to do with Spring Boot. Spring Boot would automatically provide all that stuff for

30
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,790
you, so that you can really concentrate on developing your business logic.

31
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:01,160
All the infrastructure would come free for you.

32
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:09,330
The idea behind this step was to give you an idea of the world before Spring Boot. If we directly jump into

33
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:10,110
spring boot,

34
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:16,020
You might not really appreciate  the value that Spring Boot provides. All the stuff which we looked at in

35
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:23,640
this specific example would be replaced by a simple starter project called Spring Boot startup web.

36
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,550
In combination with Spring Boot starter security.

37
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:35,100
Just the combination of these two starters would eliminate the need for a lot of configuration that

38
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:42,000
we looked at this specific step. We will look at those starters and a lot more about spring boot in

39
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,540
the subsequent steps.

40
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:44,310
Until the next step, bye-bye.
