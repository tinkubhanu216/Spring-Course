00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:09,210
In the last couple of videos, we were introduced to the ‘What’ devote and the ‘How’ of Web services. In this

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:15,990
Video, let’s revise some of the key terminology that is associated with Web services. Request, Response, Message

3
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:17,370
exchange format.

4
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,080
We’ll look at what is a service provider.

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,730
What is a service consumer. What is a

6
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,370
service definition and what is transport.

7
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:32,340
Let's start with a request and response. Request is the input of our service and response is the output

8
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:40,030
from a web service. Message exchange format is the format of the request and the response.

9
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:41,730
 Are we using XML?

10
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:43,240
Are we using JSON?

11
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,230
What is the format of the request and response.

12
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,020
That’s basically the message exchange format.

13
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:57,270
The next key terminology is service provider and service consumer. Application A

14
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:03,820
wants to consume a service from the web service which is present in here.

15
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:13,560
The web service here is called a service provider. Service provider is the one which hosts the web service.

16
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:18,980
The service consumer is the one which is consuming the web service. Application A

17
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:23,820
in this example is a consumer of the web service.

18
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:31,170
In this example, the java application, the dot net application and the PHP application are the consumers of the web

19
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,190
Service. We looked at the service provider - the guy who is providing this service.

20
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,300
Service consumer is who is using the service.

21
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:43,380
The next important terminology is service definition.

22
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:50,780
The service definition is the contract between the service provider and the service consumers.

23
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:55,580
The service definition defines what is the format of the request and response.

24
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,810
XML or JSON? What is the structure of the request.

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,060
What is the structure of the response and where is this service available.

26
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:08,480
That’s the end point. Endpoint defines

27
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:11,590
what URL is the service is exposed at.

28
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:19,080
How can these service consumer call this service which is exposed by the service provider.

29
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:29,580
The other key terminology is transport. Transport defines how a service is called. Is the service exposed

30
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:30,590
over Internet.

31
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,320
So I'll be given a URL and I'll call it.

32
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:38,080
Or is the service exposed over a Queue. Two popular formats

33
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:40,620
are HTTP and MQ.

34
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,040
HTTP is

35
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:49,800
basically over the web. Just like you type a URL in the browser, in a similar way application A would call

36
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,160
the web service.

37
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:58,980
The other format is MQ is to use communication over a queue. The service requester would place a message

38
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,370
in the queue. The service provider would be listening on the queue.

39
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:10,370
And as soon as there's a request on the queue it would take the request, do the processing of it, create

40
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:17,640
the response and put it back in the queue and the service requester would get the response from the queue.

41
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,690
The transport which is used is MQ.

42
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:25,570
It does not necessarily be Websphere MQ, it can be any other MQs as well.

43
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:29,050
But the fact is, the communication happens over queue.

44
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:34,300
This is called a web service which is exposed over the transport MQ.

45
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:41,040
The last key terminology we looked at was transport. Transport indicates whether the service is exposed

46
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:48,480
over a queue or whether its exposed over the web. Thats the Internet. Idea behind this video is to provide

47
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:55,770
a quick overview of all the key terminology which is associated with Web services.

48
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,320
Most of this is what we have discussed in the earlier videos.

49
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:05,880
We wanted to make sure that there is no ambiguity in understanding of these key terminology because

50
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:11,140
we would be using this terminology during the next steps of this course.

51
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,770
Until the next video, bye-bye.
