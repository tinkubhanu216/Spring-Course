00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:06,830
Spring data JPA makes it easy to manage your entities.

2
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:14,450
Once you have defined your entities and defined the mapping to the database, that it! Spring data repository

3
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:18,220
would provide a lot of useful methods to manage them.

4
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,220
In the previous step, we be made use of this save method.

5
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:23,570
Let's start with using a few more methods.

6
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:29,410
That's one of the important methods which is present in the user repository, user repository dot

7
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:38,510
find. If I want to find by Id, I can use the method find by Id and you can see that find by Id uses a long.

8
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:43,990
So I’ll say, I'd want to find the user who has an Id one. And assign it to a local variable.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,650
This actually returns an optional.

10
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:55,810
So I’ll say user with id one and I would say user is not created but it is actually retreived.

11
00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:01,600
So I've got the user who has the Id one retrieved from the database.

12
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:07,040
The other options user repository provides is to query all users.

13
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:14,900
So let's say dot find all and I'll assign this to a list and let's call it users

14
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:24,560
and let's also log all users plus. We’re using couple of methods from the user repository. Actually user repository has

15
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,920
a lot of methods.

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,990
So you’d see that user repository has a count method, a delete method

17
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:34,220
You can actually delete in batch. You can check whether something exists or not.

18
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:41,960
You can do wide variety of searches using find and also you have methods to save. So save method is used

19
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:47,230
to insert and also to update an entity.

20
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:51,050
There are a wide variety of methods that are there in the user repositary. I would recommend you

21
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:55,470
to try and see what are the methods that are there and try to play around with them.

22
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,120
For now,

23
00:01:56,150 --> 00:02:02,090
let's restrict ourselves for these two things and let's start running the application. I’ll stop this

24
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:03,790
and start it again.

25
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:09,240
The application will take it…take a while to launch up because we have put it in debug mode.

26
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:11,000
Now it's complete execution.

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,320
If you look at the log, you'd see a few things that are printed.

28
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,480
So one of the things which is printed is user is retrieved, so we are able to retrieve the user

29
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:20,610
with id one.

30
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:23,260
The name is Jack and we see the role is admin.

31
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:29,690
And also we see all users printed in the log. So all users, user with id 1 and Id 2, so we are able

32
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:31,360
to retrive all the users back.

33
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:37,880
We saw how user repository is very useful in simplifying interactions with the entities in managing

34
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:38,890
entities.

35
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:43,680
So now with Spring data JPA all that we need to do is define the entities.

36
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:51,910
So once you have defined entities, Spring data JPA makes it really really easy to manage those entities.

37
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,180
Until the next step, bye bye.
