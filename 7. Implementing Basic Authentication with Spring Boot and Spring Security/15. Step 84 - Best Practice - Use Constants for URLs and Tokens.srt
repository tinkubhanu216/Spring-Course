00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:03,880
Welcome back.
1

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:11,720
One of the things that we have done across all the services, is hard coded the URL of the services.
2

3
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:16,880
One  of the important things is, as we change from one environment to another environment,  this
3

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,340
stuff can change.
4

5
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,750
That's the reason why we would actually want to create constants for all this stuff.
5

6
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:27,700
What we'll do now is we will create a constant right?
6

7
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,680
Let's go to the root of the app.
7

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:42,040
Over here, let's create a new file, call this app.constants.ts, and over here we can create.
8

9
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:45,890
all the constants that we would want to use at a later point in time.
9

10
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:49,040
We can replace this based on which environment
10

11
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:50,210
We are working with.
11

12
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:57,840
So what do we do? We define a constant,  just call it API URL =  and you can put the URL over here.
12

13
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:03,700
the API in here, and copied and pasted in here.
13

14
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,620
Now that we have created the constant, let.
14

15
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:09,730
go to the todo data service, and I can make use of this constant.
15

16
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:14,640
If you look at the data service,  we already have this URL  hard coded in here.
16

17
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:18,780
So what I can do here is dollar with braces.
17

18
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:20,150
Put that specific thing.
18

19
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:26,710
It would give you a compilation error, control space command space and import the API so you can see
19

20
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:28,970
that it's being imported from our content.
20

21
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:30,640
Yep that's right.
21

22
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:35,840
And now let's see retrieve all todos for the user page continues to work.
22

23
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:39,200
You can see if I go to home and come back to todos, it's working.
23

24
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,590
So the real change that we made is fine.
24

25
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:47,750
So let's go out and replace this in all the other places where we have hardcoded it, in this specific
25

26
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:48,310
thing.
26

27
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,290
Cool.
27

28
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,100
Over here actually may be a good idea to find and replace across all the files.
28

29
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,630
Now, we have replaced it in this specific file.
29

30
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:17,390
You do an update and save if you do want to do it, and you see that they all keep working.
30

31
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,370
I have to learn to translate one of them.
31

32
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,210
So the todos do work.
32

33
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:28,010
The other thing we can do, is related to the authentication service and the basic authentication service.
33

34
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:34,990
If you look at our tokens and the authenticated users which be setting in this session storage, there
34

35
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:37,850
is a big chance that you might have typos.
35

36
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:41,320
So you can use constants even to prevent that kind of stuff.
36

37
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:50,620
So I'll say export constant, and I'll have token constant and I'll have authenticated user constant.
37

38
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:58,130
Constant export constant authenticated user, that kind of constant.
38

39
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,780
I don't really want to be imported from anywhere else.
39

40
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,620
Export constraint is called.
40

41
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:07,050
And I would want to use the strings which are present in here.
41

42
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,360
So this is authenticated user.
42

43
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:15,690
I just want to not make mistakes, so I want to copy it from here.
43

44
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,590
Copied and pasted down here.
44

45
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:26,490
So what we are doing here, is making sure that we are using a constant values are imported. This would ensure
45

46
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:31,640
that they would not be any typos. If you make a mistake with the content you would get a compilation error.
46

47
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:39,530
So that's better than finding problems at a later point in time because I made a mistake with that typo.
47

48
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:43,130
So I would go for a TOKEN here as well.
48

49
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,440
And the same thing with the authenticated user.
49

50
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:53,750
So when you find yourself using the same kind of constants,  same kind of values multiple times, I
50

51
00:03:53,750 --> 00:04:00,940
would recommend you to use a constant to present the value, and use it cross the place.
51

52
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:01,470
That's good.
52

53
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:06,870
So we have just one more left to do that.
53

54
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:17,020
Oh here you can see that I'm still using the all the other things, so let's while we're here, while you're
54

55
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,860
at. And one of the most important thing is when the way you change, the way you I will make sure that
55

56
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:28,160
we're using because we're using ticks over here, so would get the list.
56

57
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:36,420
Now let's make sure that the application remains working. Update, you say delete and
57

58
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:47,180
and log out, and then login. cool! Now, 
58

59
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:53,870
we have the entire application up and running, and we have to practice a little bit to use constants.
59

60
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,810
But the great thing about having url as a constant, at a later point in time.
60

61
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,010
You can replace it with a variable.
61

62
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:05,520
So app.constants.ts could be the single most place where you would put all the variables and
62

63
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:10,050
when you're building something for a different environment, you can replace it with the specific value
63

64
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,760
for a specific use, and be done with it.
64

65
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:15,760
I'm having a great time and I hope you're having a great time with the Course as well.
65

66
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:17,510
I'll see you in the next Video! Until then, bye!
