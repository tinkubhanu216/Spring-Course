00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:08,940
Welcome back. In the previous steps, we have coded the handle basic authentication login method.
1

2
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:15,040
We created the basic authentication service, and we are ready to now connect it to the log in page.
2

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,310
Let's go ahead and do that.
3

4
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:22,530
in this specific step. So let's  go to the login.component.html, and we're here right now what are
4

5
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:25,170
we doing, when we are logging in?
5

6
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,700
We are calling handle login, and handle logging defined.
6

7
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:34,400
This is the method which is defined. What you want to change to, is handle basic logging.
7

8
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:41,280
So what I'll do is I'll copy this and replace ops.
8

9
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:50,850
It should be the basic log in, and what I'll do is I'll comment this command-/ or control-/
9

10
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:57,450
it is just for future reference, just in case we need it handle basic login.
10

11
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:00,580
So did we get it right? handle basic or login.
11

12
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,520
Looks good.
12

13
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,750
It's time to test what we have been doing until now. in28 minutes.
13

14
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:11,290
Dummy and log in.
14

15
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:11,980
Cool.
15

16
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,320
This is working.
16

17
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:19,470
We are getting a welcome message, it is calling the basic authentication service and this is fine.
17

18
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,960
Now I'm doing a log out.
18

19
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,840
Let's do a log in now.
19

20
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:26,400
Let's change the password to something else and press login.
20

21
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,090
This is also succeeding.
21

22
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,320
You know why the request is succeeding?
22

23
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:36,240
The reason this is working is because whatever header we are setting, is getting overridden by the http
23

24
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:43,130
interceptro that which we created earlier. Over here, we hardcoded the user id and password and that's overriding
24

25
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:48,150
what the stuff that we have put in. So there is something you should always be cautious about.
25

26
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:55,910
Well here we are using a hard coded thing, and that is what is causing the problem .Now,
26

27
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,150
Let's disable this.
27

28
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,230
http interceptor for a little while.
28

29
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,500
We'll enable it a little later, while we get to the rest of this stuff.
29

30
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:09,090
For now let's go to the app.module and let's disable this.
30

31
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:14,430
So what I'll do, is select this and press control-/ or command-/
31

32
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,240
This line is commented out.
32

33
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,670
Now let's see what would happen.
33

34
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:27,800
Log out and try to login back. in28minutes,dummy login.
34

35
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:29,670
This works.
35

36
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:31,080
That's good.
36

37
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:35,160
Now log out and login back again in28minutes.
37

38
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:37,630
Some other password. cool!
38

39
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:38,490
Invalid!
39

40
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:39,410
Great!
40

41
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:45,120
That's awesome right! The first time we're seeing invalid credentials. The great thing is now you are validating
41

42
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,770
the user id and password against the backend, and that's awesome.
42

43
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:52,830
There are a number of things that we need to fix going forward.
43

44
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:59,010
A lot of hard coded stuff, we have disabled HTTP interceptor but it's still a minor victory.
44

45
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:04,080
We are able to now connect to a backend service.
45

46
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,730
I'll see you in the next step.
46

47
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:09,030
We would work on all the other stuff. Until then,  bye!
