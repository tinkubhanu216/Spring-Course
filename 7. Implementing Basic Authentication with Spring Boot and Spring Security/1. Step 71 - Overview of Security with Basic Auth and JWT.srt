Welcome back.

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:10,090
Welcome to this new section on securing the application that we have built.
2

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,150
What do we mean by securing the application that we have built?
3

4
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:20,250
One of the things you'd have observed is when we execute any request, we are not really needed to pass
4

5
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,550
in a new userid and password.
5

6
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:29,340
So all the HTTP requests which we are executing now, are executed without user id and password. I can
6

7
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:36,010
just go in and type in a URL, and get the details of the todo, or I can go in and if you are looking
7

8
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:43,520
at the list of all the todos which are present in here. and that's what we mean by unsecured applications.
8

9
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:49,230
You don't really need to provide any credentials to be able to access these services. So if somebody
9

10
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:52,370
knows the URL, then that's sufficient for them.
10

11
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:56,910
They would be able to break into the application, and use the information which is present in it, and
11

12
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:58,620
that's not good.
12

13
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:06,150
So in the next few steps, we would start our journey toward securing the data application. Start using
13

14
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:13,050
a basic approach called basic authentication, there along with every request you'd need to send a user
14

15
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:15,230
id and password.
15

16
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:21,270
So if I have to agree to this request, I would need to send in a user id and password. Just because the
16

17
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:26,820
fact that sending a user id and password with every request, is not safe because if somebody gets the
17

18
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,870
user id and password then they can do anything with it.
18

19
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:38,520
And that's where we create a temporary token call JWT JSON Web Token, and we'll discuss about what is
19

20
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,480
the difference between basic security and JWT, and how JWT is more secure.
20

21
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:50,750
We enhance our services with authentication, and have our front end application connect do it.
21

22
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:55,710
There are a wide variety of changes that we need to do and, get set for all of them. I'll see you
22

23
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:56,710
in the next step.
23

24
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:57,390
Until then, bye!
