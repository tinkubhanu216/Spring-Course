Welcome back.
1

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:09,810
One of the things you would have already observed is the fact that our login page still uses hard coded
2

3
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:11,200
authentication.
3

4
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:17,180
What we do in the step is, let's create a service in the backend. The idea behind that is when the user
4

5
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:18,300
is trying to log in,
5

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:24,530
We try to hit the service, and if the service returns validated  response, then that means the user
6

7
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:25,970
is authenticated.
7

8
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,690
Otherwise it is not really authenticated.
8

9
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:34,040
Let's move to the back end, and let's quickly create a service and copy the hello world controller and
9

10
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,490
hello world be in the basic package.
10

11
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:45,170
And you see a few errors coming in in this console,  because there are a number of methods.
11

12
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,310
with the same URL.
12

13
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:55,250
So let's remove the other two methods quickly, and I'll change this to basic.
13

14
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,110
So URL mapping,
14

15
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:03,020
This is a GET request to a basic auth, and the other thing I'll do is this is using return.
15

16
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:06,930
So let me check which HellowWorldBean is being made use of.
16

17
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:08,870
So it's used in the same package.
17

18
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,560
So what I did was, I renamed this all.. shift-R, like the factory rename.
18

19
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:24,250
I renamed this to authentication bean, and I'll send a message saying you authenticate it at a later.
19

20
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:28,590
point in time. You can actually send a lot more details as part of the response.
20

21
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:35,880
Maybe the rules the user has, and things like that, but now it's sitting just authenticated message back.
21

22
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:38,290
So this is the bean, that's cool!
22

23
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:40,010
Let's quickly look at the packages.
23

24
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:43,700
So we have an authentication bean and it's called Helloworld controller.
24

25
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:46,390
Now this is not HelloWorldController. Call 
25

26
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:54,360
this as basic authentication controller, actually factory you name it.
26

27
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:59,300
And now, you'd see that the application restarted fine.
27

28
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,010
So you see that everything is fine.
28

29
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:03,230
We have a new service created.
29

30
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:07,800
Let's organize the import export import our control shift.
30

31
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,590
And all the unused imports are gone.
31

32
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:14,620
Now we have a clean basic authentication controller.
32

33
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,010
The idea is very simple.
33

34
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,240
You'll be able to get here.
34

35
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,960
We're from using the basic authentication.
35

36
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,740
And therefore when somebody is trying to login, what we want to do is we want to hit this URL.
36

37
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:28,750
And if he's having the proper authentication details, then it would send.
37

38
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:30,100
This response back.
38

39
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:35,230
Most of the authentication is actually done because of the automated configuration by spring security
39

40
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:39,810
in combination with these specific configuration that we provided.
40

41
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:42,880
I'm having a lot of fun, and I'm sure you're having a lot of fun too.
41

42
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:48,100
Security is a lot of fun topic, and there was a lot of hard work in configuring all this stuff and getting
42

43
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,530
them to work together.
43

44
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,450
I'm sure you're going to enjoy it further.
44

45
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:52,440
I'll see you the next step.
45

46
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,200
Until then, bye!
